    <p>
        In 1996, Joe Poole decided to leave Maniac Spider Trash behind and formed the more punk inspired Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13
        with Doug McCollum and Robby McGalliard. With the release of the band's first album, The Late Late Late Show,
        the members revealed their new stage namesâ€”Wednesday 13, Sicko Zero, and Seaweed. As a 3-piece band, Wednesday 13 handled the song writing,
        vocals, and guitar work. In 1997, Ray Franks was invited to step in to carry the guitar duties and assumed the stage name Abby Normal.
        The years that followed spawned many songs that would go on to become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_punk"> horror punk</a> cult classics and many
        performances that left audiences entertained, shocked, and bewildered.
